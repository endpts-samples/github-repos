# GitHub Repo Stats API

This sample demonstrates how to build an API endpoint that calls the GitHub API to list the repositories for a specific user.

## Local Development

> **NOTE:** Node 18.x or greater is required

To get started locally, install the dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

With the development server running, you can call the endpoint with Curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/endpts/repos
```

## Deploying to endpts.io

Deploy your project to the cloud with [endpts.io](https://dashboard.endpts.io) ([Deployment documentation](https://endpts.io/docs/core-concepts/deployments)).
